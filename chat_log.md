## User Request 1
User requested to add multiple buy options and a remove function to their "Spend Elon's Money" game with the following requirements:
1. Multiple buy option for items
2. Can only buy companies once
3. Add remove/sell function for purchased items

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented the following features:

### 1. Multiple Buy Options
- Added quantity input fields next to buy buttons
- Users can specify how many items they want to purchase at once
- Input validation ensures minimum of 1 item

### 2. Company Purchase Restriction
- Companies (items with "Whole Company" in the name) can only be purchased once
- After purchasing a company, the buy button is disabled and shows "Already Owned"
- Quantity is automatically limited to 1 for company purchases

### 3. Sell/Remove Functionality
- Added sell buttons for all owned items
- Users can specify quantity to sell
- Selling returns the full purchase price to the balance
- Input validation ensures users can't sell more than they own

### 4. UI Improvements

- Better visual feedback with disabled states for owned companies
- Quantity inputs with proper min/max validation

## Technical Changes
- Modified `populateItems()` function to handle dynamic UI based on ownership

- Added `showNotification()` function for user feedback
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## User Request 2
User requested that Tesla, SpaceX, and X companies should already be owned by default (since Elon Musk owns these companies).

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented pre-ownership of Elon Musk's companies:

### Changes Made
1. **Set Initial Ownership**: Modified the data to show Tesla, SpaceX, and X as already owned (owned: 1)
2. **Added to Purchase History**: These companies are automatically added to the purchased items list when the page loads
3. **UI Updates**: These companies now show "Already Owned" instead of a buy button
4. **Receipt Integration**: Pre-owned companies appear in the receipt with a special flag

### Technical Implementation
- Updated the initialization code in `DOMContentLoaded` event
- Added pre-owned companies to `purchasedItems` array on page load
- Modified the owned property in the data structure for these three companies
- Total value of pre-owned companies: $944 billion (Tesla: $800B, SpaceX: $100B, X: $44B)

## User Request 3
User requested to remove Tesla, SpaceX, and X from the receipt since they are pre-owned companies.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully removed pre-owned companies from appearing in the receipt:

### Changes Made
1. **Removed from Purchase History**: Pre-owned companies (Tesla, SpaceX, X) are no longer added to the purchasedItems array
2. **Clean Receipt**: The receipt now only shows items actually purchased by the user during gameplay
3. **UI Consistency**: These companies still show as "Already Owned" in the franchise section but don't appear in receipts

### Technical Implementation
- Removed the code that was adding pre-owned companies to `purchasedItems` array
- Tesla, SpaceX, and X remain marked as owned in the data structure but don't pollute the purchase history
- This ensures a cleaner receipt that only shows user's actual spending decisions
